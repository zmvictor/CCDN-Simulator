This is a CCDN simulator written in C++. It is built on NS3.

To compile and use the simulator:

2) Copy node.h into ns-3.xx/src/ to replace the origin one.

3) Put ccdnsim.cc into scratch/. 

4) File input is an example of input format.

Check the related source code to further develop the simulator if you need.
